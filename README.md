## What does this project do??

The name of the project has three main points:

1. Cross Platform:

  This project designed to be runnable cross different platforms, such as PC, Browser, and Smart Phones;

2. Metaverse:

  In this project, users will have their own characters and be able to:
  - Walk around in the metaverse-like environment and see each other;
  - Talk by typing or voice chat;
  - Showing others your collections such as NFTs and character items;
  - Trade with others;
3. Trade:

  Users will trade with E-wallet (e.g. Edge Wallet) using FIAT(e.g. US$) or Crypto currencies(e.g. Bitcoin).
