# CrossMetaTrade

## This is the Personal project for Microsoft Hackathon 2022.

So far there is only one member in the team. Might update this later if we have more people who are interested in this project. Apply without any hesitation if you are:

1. Interested in any of the relevant topic: Metaverse, NFTs, Unity Game Development, Blender/3DMax modeling;
2. Locates in Suzhou, Greater China Region;

## What does this project do??

The name of the project has three main points:

1. Cross Platform:

  This project designed to be runnable cross different platforms, such as PC, Browser, and Smart Phones;

2. Metaverse:

  In this project, users will have their own characters and be able to:
  - Walk around in the metaverse-like environment and see each other;
  - Talk by typing or voice chat;
  - Showing others your collections such as NFTs and character items;
  - Trade with others;
3. Trade:

  Users will trade with E-wallet (e.g. Edge Wallet) using FIAT(e.g. US$) or Crypto currencies(e.g. Bitcoin).
  
 ## Tech stacks for each steps:
 
 - Game play
 1. Unity for game development, character control, multi-player synchronization;
 2. Blender for simple modeling works;
 
 - Browser platform
 To let our game running in the Browser, we will need a Frontend project. Thus, we will be using React to build a web application which built by Unity's WebGL support and runs our game in the Browser.
 
 - Backend Server
 1. For the main game, choose Photon as our Game Server. If we have more time/members later, will consider write our own game server;
 2. Will publish React Project on GitHub so that people could enter the Meta Space through public URL;
 
 - Others
 1. Will use Unity's Agora Video SDK for Voice chat system.
